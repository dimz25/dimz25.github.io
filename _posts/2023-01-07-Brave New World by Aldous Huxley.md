---

"Brave New World" is a dystopian novel written by Aldous Huxley and published in 1932. The story is set in a future society where people are artificially created and conditioned to fulfill predetermined roles in the social order. The society is governed by a group of scientists and philosophers who use advanced technologies, such as hypnopaedia (sleep teaching) and psychological conditioning, to control the population and maintain social stability.

The main characters in the story are Bernard Marx, John the Savage, and Lenina Crowne. Bernard is an outsider in the society because he is not satisfied with his predetermined social role and is critical of the society's values. John is a native of the New World who was raised on a reservation and is unfamiliar with the society's practices. Lenina is a high-ranking member of the society and is responsible for bringing John back to the New World.

The story follows the experiences of these characters as they navigate the society of the New World and confront the challenges and conflicts that arise. Through their experiences, the novel explores themes of individuality, freedom, and control, and raises questions about the role of technology in shaping society. In the end, John the Savage kills himself, symbolizing the death of the traditional values and ways of life represented by the Savage Reservation.
