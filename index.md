# Hi! 

I'm [Dimitri](/me), welcome on my website. I mainly use this space to collect thoughts and ideas and share them in the form of [notes](/notes). You'll also find some (not many) photoprojects I'm working on at the moment.

### Projects

* A photoproject where I document my visits in Semporna and the surrounding [Bajau Laut](projects/bajau-laut) communities
* Some [portraits](projects/portraits) I took from family, friends and stranger-friends
* Random [snapshots](projects/snapshots)

### More stuff

You can visit my "[now](/now)" page with the stuff I'm focussing on right now.
And there's also a list of some of the more interesting [books](/books) I read.
