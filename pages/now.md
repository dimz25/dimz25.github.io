# Now

Right now I'm in the process of mastering the technicalities of analog photography.
I started developing black and white film at home, soon followed by color film.
I'm putting in place a setup that will allow me to digitalize my analog shots with a dslr camera.
Next steps are learning to print the negative on paper.

For fun, I'm also (re-)learing Javascript.  
I'm using the free learning book [Eloquent Javascript](https://eloquentjavascript.net/index.html).
